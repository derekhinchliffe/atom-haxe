# TODO

Tasks required to make haxe-rewrite ready to replace current atom-haxe master branch + some improvements and additions.

[ ] Implement go to definition properly (at least keep parity with master branch)
[ ] Clicking project file on status bar displays a target chooser. Move this chooser as a standalone "select target" command
[ ] Restore settings existing in master branch
[ ] Add a setting to allow/disable message panel auto-hide (could be a close delay set to 0 to disable)
[ ] Add a setting to restart haxe server automatically every X seconds (0 to never restart)
[ ] Add a command to restart haxe server manually
